Boris Nujic Portfolio

Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights 2 diferent previous positions providing links to the products I've worked with, provides a list of skills and references by previous employers, as well as a little about myself.



UX

The sample project from Haley Schafer was the inspiration/backbone for this page, I really liked the clean design and tried to reflect it as good as I could.

Technologies

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (3.3.7)

Features

This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size.

Testing

This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.

Credits
Content
All content in the "About Me" and "Work" sections in this portfolio site were written by me.

Media

All photos were non-autor/non-copyrighted photos from diverse publications found on the web. A greyscale filter was applied to each one prior to upload to preserve the greyscale theme.

Acknowledgements
Need to acknowledge and point out that part of the code for my project came from Haley Schafer's sample project found on Codeinstitute. 

This is for educational use.
